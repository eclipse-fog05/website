# Communication

The Eclipse fog05 community is most readily found on
[its gitter channel](https://gitter.im/atolab/fog05), where you're welcome to
ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.

# Issues

Github is used for tracking issues. The primary location for these is the main
[Eclipse fog05 repository](https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/issues).

If you're a Eclipse fog05 user, you're highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues
and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how design tradeoffs might
affect you.

# Get Involved

Are you interested in getting involved with the code? Please refer to [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Eclipse Incubation
All new projects start in the incubation phase (a project in the incubation phase is said to be incubating). The classification of a project in the incubation phase is not a statement about the quality of the project’s code; rather, the incubation phase is more about the project team’s progress in practicing the open and public processes necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, and users) around the project.

# Eclipse Foundation
The Eclipse Foundation provides our global community of individuals and organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for open source software collaboration and innovation. The Foundation is home to the Eclipse IDE, Jakarta EE, and over 350 open source projects, including runtimes, tools, and frameworks for a wide range of technology domains such as the Internet of Things, automotive,geospatial, systems engineering, and many others.
