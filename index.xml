Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems) it is based on a decentralized architecture.
Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications, packaged as containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This possibility is achieved thanks to Eclipse fog05 plugin architecture.
More specifically, Eclipse fog05 is a Fog Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution composed by two major components:</description></item><item><title>FOrcE Installation</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/force-installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/force-installation/</guid><description>Before getting started with Eclipse fog05 orchestation we need to install and start it

Its aims is to leverage compute and storage resources are closer to the robots in order to augment their capabilities while keeping latency under control and enabling new use-cases.
Moreover it also introduces the possibility to elaborate data closer to where they are produced and gives the user control on the data shared with third parties like cloud platform.</description></item><item><title>Eclipse fog05 - 0.2 Release</title><link>https://fog05.io/blog/2020-06-release-0-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/blog/2020-06-release-0-2/</guid><description>We are glad to announce that Eclipse fog05 got it&amp;rsquo;s 0.2.0 release.

Whilst fog computing is increasingly recognized as the key paradigm at the foundation of Consumer and Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), most of the initiatives on fog computing focus on extending cloud infrastructure.
As a consequence, these infrastructure fall short in addressing heterogeneity and resource constraints characteristics of fog computing environments.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/hello-world/</guid><description>To kick off our tour of Eclipse fog05 and to demonstrate use and access of the Fog Infrastructure Manager, we will start with the obligatory &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; example. This example will deploy a docker container that just prints &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
First, we need to install containerdm the containerd plugin for Eclipse fog05 and the fog05 client API.
$ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.1/containerd.io_1.3.4-1_amd64.deb $ wget https://github.com/eclipse-fog05/fog05/releases/download/v0.2.1/fog05-plugin-fdu-containerd_0.2.1-1_amd64.deb $ sudo apt install .</description></item><item><title>Introducing fosctl</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/introducing-fosctl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/introducing-fosctl/</guid><description>Eclipse fog05 provides a command line tool to facilitate the interaction with its orchestration engine. If you want to use fosctl you need to install FOrcE please follow the instructions.
fosctl can be installed both for source of from its debian package
Once it is installed we can use it
From source Eclipse fog05 fosctl is written in rust, hence to build it from source you need a functional rust environment.</description></item><item><title>Eclipse fog05 with ETSI OSM Orchestrator</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/etsi-osm-interop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/getting-started/etsi-osm-interop/</guid><description>Eclipse fog05 is compatible with ETSI OSM, and can be used as a VIM by this one. Current interoperability is limited to simple NS using LXD containers as VNFs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have a multi node fog05 deployment and we want to connect this deployment to OSM to instantiate VNFs.
First let&amp;rsquo;s add the VIM account to OSM

Fog Orchestration Engine (FOrcE) Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM) Both modules provides different abstractions an APIs.
Fog Infrastrucutre Manager This module virtualises the hardware infrastructure, such as computational, communication, storage and I/O resources.
It provides key primitives for the management of the infrastructure and the application deployed in it. An example on how to interact with the FIM can be found in getting started guide.</description></item><item><title>Write a Runtime Plugin</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/going-deeper/write_runtime_plugin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/going-deeper/write_runtime_plugin/</guid><description>Runtime Plugin The Runtime plugin implements the life-cycle management for FDU, is has to strictly follow the state machine defined for the FDU and provide handles for the state management and monitoring for the running FDUs.
This picture represent the state machine that an FDU has to follow.
States Each FDU can be in one of those nine states:

Location Transparent state access and distribution - How fog05 uses Zenoh</description></item><item><title>Location transparent state access and distribution</title><link>https://fog05.io/docs/internals/zenoh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/docs/internals/zenoh/</guid><description>Eclipse fog05 uses Zenoh to provide location-transparent access to the system state and to distribute this state.
Distributed state Eclipse fog05 is designed from the beginning to not rely in any centralized construct, such as DB servers, controllers and so on.
We made this choice because the problem Eclipse fog05 is trying to address it the management on the Fog infrastructure which by definition is distributed, heterogenous, mobile and with intermittent connectivity.</description></item><item><title>The Eclipse fog05 Community</title><link>https://fog05.io/community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fog05.io/community/</guid><description>Communication The Eclipse fog05 community is most readily found on its gitter channel, where you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.
Issues Github is used for tracking issues. The primary location for these is the main Eclipse fog05 repository.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a Eclipse fog05 user, you&amp;rsquo;re highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how design tradeoffs might affect you.</description></item></channel></rss>
